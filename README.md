XcodeWarnings.xcconfig is an Xcode configuration file that lists all warnings and static analyzer
settings present in Xcode 10. Comment out any settings that won't help your project.

Accompanying blog post: [Xcode Warnings: Can You Turn Them Up to Eleven?](https://qualitycoding.org/xcode-warnings/)

All warnings are enabled, with these exceptions:

**Commented Out by Default**

- "Treat Warnings as Errors" (`GCC_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS`) isn't enabled because when
  experimenting with code, I sometimes temporarily comment out a line which uses a variable â€” which
  triggers the "Unused Variables" warning.
- "Unused Parameters" (`GCC_WARN_UNUSED_PARAMETER`) isn't enabled because it's not unusual to
  provide a method required by Apple's frameworks that ignores a parameter.
- "Multiple Definition Types for Selector" (`GCC_WARN_MULTIPLE_DEFINITION_TYPES_FOR_SELECTOR`) isn't
  enabled because it's not unusual to have a `@selector` on its own, apart from a method definition.

**Not Even Included**

- "Pedantic Warnings" (`GCC_WARN_PEDANTIC`) isn't included because ordinary interaction with Apple's
  libraries makes it unhappy.
- "Implicit Synthesized Properties" (`CLANG_WARN_OBJC_MISSING_PROPERTY_SYNTHESIS`) isn't included
  because in all likelihood, you don't need to be backwards compatible with non-modern Objective-C.

Static Analyzer
---------------

The Static Analyzer is also completely enabled, including "Deep" analysis during the Build action.
If that's too slow, comment out `CLANG_STATIC_ANALYZER_MODE` to restore faster "Shallow" analysis.

Swift 4.2 Performance
---------------------

The setting "Exclusive Access to Memory" (`SWIFT_ENFORCE_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS`) is set to `"on"` which is Full Enforcement (Run-time Checks in All Builds). If you see performance degradation in your release builds, you may want to change this from `"on"` to `"debug-only"` so that the checks are done only in debug builds.
